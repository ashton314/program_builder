** Getting Started

To start a dev database, run =mix docker.db start=.

** Outstanding Tasks

*** TODO Add new models [0/2]

 - [ ] Create a =members= model
 - [ ] Add an =event= model, along with sub-models like =music=, =talk=, =generic=, and =note=

*** TODO Modify =meeting= model [0/1]

 - [ ] Add an =events= attribute: an array of =Event= id's
   Consider just blowing it all away/trying to overwrite. Original command was:

       mix phx.gen.html Program Meeting meetings date:date presiding:string conducting:string visiting:string invocation:references:members benediction:references:members accompanist:string chorester:string opening_hymn:integer sacrament_hymn:integer closing_hymn:integer
