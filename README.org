* Program Builder

** Getting Started

To start a dev database, run =mix docker.db start=.

** Outstanding Tasks

*** DONE Add new models [2/2]

 - [X] Create a =members= model
 - [X] Add an =event= model, along with sub-models like =music=, =talk=, =generic=, and =note=

*** DONE Modify =meeting= model [2/2]

 - [X] Add an =events= attribute: an array of =Event= id's
   Consider just blowing it all away/trying to overwrite. Original command was:

       mix phx.gen.html Program Meeting meetings date:date presiding:string conducting:string visiting:string invocation:references:members benediction:references:members accompanist:string chorester:string opening_hymn:integer sacrament_hymn:integer closing_hymn:integer

   Modified command:

       mix phx.gen.html Program Meeting meetings date:date presiding:string conducting:string visiting:string invocation:references:members benediction:references:members accompanist:string chorester:string opening_hymn:integer sacrament_hymn:integer closing_hymn:integer topic:string events:array:integer

 - [X] Add a =topic= attribute
*** TODO Consider baby blessings
I think I might have to rip out the :sacrament_hymn bit of the meeting and push that into the events. It'll have to be a default.
